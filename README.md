# Policy Gradients Mulit armed Bandit Problem

Overview
=========
Policy Gradients is one of the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm. In this method, a simple neural-network learns a policy for picking actions by adjusting it's weights through gradient descent using feedback from our environment.

In this experiment we are going to consider 4 armed bandit and find an optimal policy to get maximum rewards.

Dependencies
============
* Jupyter Notebook
* Numpy
* Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
